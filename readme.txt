== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I find the right URLs to Dipdive media? =

The best place to grab a URL is when you're viewing the video/audio/poll on its own page. Your browser's address bar will contain an URL similar to `http://channel.dipdive.com/media/1234`. Sometimes you will find embedded media at Dipdive, for instance in a blog post. In that case, use the embed player to copy the link. This link will also be similar to the one we just described.

= When I insert a video I don't see it. I just see some weird text? =

The button helps you insert the code that embeds a video. What you see is a `[dipdive]` tag with a media URL. When you preview or publish your post or page you'll see that the tag has been replaced with a player. You can also write these tags by hand if you're comfortable with them.

= Aren't there any settings I can configure? =

At this moment Dipdive embed players are not resizable or customizable. There's only one way to insert them in your post so there are no settings available.

= When I press the Dipdive button the dialog box looks a bit off? =

Some plugins apply their custom styles to Wordpress UI elements which my work well for that plugin but also affects other parts of Wordpress. If the custom styles interfere with the functionality of the Dipdive plugin, find the plugin that adds these custom styles and turn it off.
